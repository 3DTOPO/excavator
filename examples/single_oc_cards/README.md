Following speeds are achieved:


GPU | Core clock delta | Memory clock delta | Power limit (W) | Speed (MH/s)
----|------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------
1070 Ti | 0 | 625 | 133 | **32**
1080 Ti | -100 | 600 | 170 | **37**
1660 Ti | -450 | 900 | 80 | **30**
2060 | -600 | 900 | 125 | **32**
2070 Super | -600 | 900 | 125 | **43**
2080 | -600 | 900 | 125 | **43**
3060 Ti | -550 | 1250 | 125 | **61**
3070 | -600 | 1200 | 125 | **60**
3080 | -150 | 900 | 220 | **96**
3090 | -300 | 950 | 285 | **118**

Provided overclocks are modest and should work on (almost) any card. Higher speeds are possible with more aggressive settings.

**Warning for 3080/3090!** Make sure your RAM chips are properly cooled. If you cannot achieve this speed, it is because your RAM is too hot and the card is throttling.

For series 2000 seems like core clock -600 and memory clock +900 is golden value. Try to go as low as possible with TDP. Some cards have hard coded minimum 125 W TDP thus better efficiency is not possible to achieve.
